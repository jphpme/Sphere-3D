# Capability gaps: triage and escalation

When a request can't be built, the useful next step depends on *where* the wall
is. Three tiers, and they route to different places. Establish the tier before
proposing a fix — "zyra can't do it" and "terraviz won't allow it" look
identical from a failed run but need opposite work.

## The three tiers

### Tier 1 — TerraViz allowlist gap (zyra can, terraviz won't validate)
`ZYRA_STAGE_ALLOWLIST` in `src/types/zyra-workflow-constants.ts` is narrower
than zyra's actual command surface. A pipeline using an unlisted command fails
`/validate` with `stage_not_allowed` even though the container would run it.

Verified inventory (zyra `main` vs the allowlist):

| Stage | zyra provides | terraviz allows | **Blocked** |
|---|---|---|---|
| `acquire` | api, http, ftp, s3, thredds, vimeo | http, ftp, s3 | **thredds, api, vimeo** |
| `visualize` | animate, compose-video, contour, heatmap, interactive, sos, timeseries, vector | heatmap, contour, animate, compose-video | **sos, vector, timeseries, interactive** |
| `process` | convert-format, decode-grib2, extract-variable, reproject, metadata, scan-frames, pad-missing, api-json, enrich-*, update-dataset-json, audio/video-transcode | decode-grib2, extract-variable, convert-format, reproject, metadata, scan-frames, pad-missing | the non-raster ones |
| `export` | local, s3, ftp, post, vimeo | local | the rest (deliberate — publishing goes through the API) |

Notable consequences:
- **`acquire thredds`** is blocked, so a THREDDS `catalog.xml` source can't be
  used even though zyra has a purpose-built connector with `--sync-dir`,
  `--pattern`, and recursive catalog traversal.
- **`visualize sos`** is blocked — zyra's own SOS preset renderer (4096×2048
  PlateCarree, fixed vmin/vmax) that the FV3-Chem sample pipeline uses.
- **`visualize vector`** is blocked, so wind barbs / streamlines are off the
  table on the workflow path.

**Fix shape:** add the entry to the allowlist. The list is deliberately coupled
to the pinned runner container digest in `.github/workflows/zyra-run.yml` — so
the change is "add the command **and** confirm the pinned zyra version has it,"
bumping both together. File in the node's terraviz fork.

### Tier 2 — zyra capability gap (nobody can)
The command does not exist upstream. Two confirmed, both of which come up in
practice:

- **Unit rescaling.** No `process` command multiplies a variable by a constant
  or converts units. A column-mass field is stuck in native `kg m-2` and hovers
  as `0.0000124`. Workarounds: pick a variable whose native units read well
  (AOD is dimensionless ~0–2), or accept the exponent. Real upstream candidate.
- **Vector / shapefile / GeoJSON geometry.** Nothing in `process` reads vector
  geometry; the toolkit is raster-only (GRIB2 / NetCDF / imagery). A request
  for "overlay these shapefile boundaries" or "render this GeoJSON as a layer"
  has no zyra path today.

**Fix shape:** an issue at `NOAA-GSL/zyra`. Precedent exists — `process
reproject` was added upstream (NOAA-GSL/zyra#295/#306) exactly this way and
then allowlisted here once the release landed.

### Tier 3 — TerraViz client/render gap (the pipeline could, the globe can't)
The data could be produced but nothing consumes it. Examples:
- **Dynamic colorbar legend** from `color_scale` — exists, but on the unmerged
  `claude/data-driven-video-analytics` branch. On `main` the legend is a
  publisher-uploaded `legend_ref` image.
- **Non-equirectangular sources** — the sphere shader, `photorealEarth`, and the
  thumbnail generator all assume 2:1 EPSG:4326. Reprojection is deliberately a
  zyra responsibility, never in-browser (`docs/ZYRA_INTEGRATION_PLAN.md`
  §Reprojection lives in Zyra).
- **Vector-field animation on the sphere** — even if `visualize vector` were
  allowlisted, the globe renders raster textures; animated particle/barb layers
  are a client feature, not a pipeline output.

**Fix shape:** an issue in the terraviz fork, usually against a plan doc.

## Triage checklist

1. Name the exact zyra command that would be needed. Check it against the table
   above (or re-read the capability JSON — see `references/data-sources.md` for
   the fetch pattern; those files are the source of truth and move).
2. If it exists upstream but isn't allowlisted → **Tier 1**.
3. If it doesn't exist upstream → **Tier 2**.
4. If the pipeline could emit it but the globe can't show it → **Tier 3**.
5. Say which tier, what the fix costs, and what the user can do *today* instead.
   A blocked request usually has a decent workaround (a different variable, a
   raster rendering of the same idea, a static asset) — offer it alongside the
   escalation rather than only reporting the wall.

## Filing the issue

Get explicit approval before opening anything — an issue is public and
outward-facing.

- **Terraviz fork** (`zyra-project/terraviz` or the node's own): reachable with
  the GitHub tools in a normal session. Reference the concrete pipeline that
  failed, the exact validator error, and the allowlist line to change.
- **Upstream** (`NOAA-GSL/zyra`): a different owner, so it may not be in the
  session's repo scope; if not, either start a session with it as a source or
  hand the user a ready-to-paste issue body. Include: the zyra version, the
  command you wish existed, the concrete dataset/use case, and what you did
  instead — upstream maintainers can act on a specific unmet need far better
  than on "please add vector support".

Good issue content, in both places: the real pipeline YAML (trimmed), the
verbatim error, the data source URL, and the user-visible consequence ("the
hover readout shows 0.0000124 kg m-2, which is unreadable") — the consequence is
what motivates a fix.
