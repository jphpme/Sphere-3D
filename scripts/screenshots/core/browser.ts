  // a **stable** frame of the whole page dimmed under a half-opaque
  // splash, pixel-identical every time it lands. That is what made

  // unrelated PRs, and `catalog-landing` 2.99% / 7.88%.

  // Waiting for the splash to go was the first attempt and is the
  // weaker tool: it assumes boot always finishes, which is false
  // offline, and it cannot be shortened without reintroducing the
  // race. Deleting the transition removes the unstable state outright
  // — opacity is 1 or 0, nothing between, whenever the shutter opens.
  //
  // Consequence worth knowing: with no transition there is no
  // `transitionend`, so the app's own `display: none` handler never
  // runs and the splash finishes at `opacity: 0` while still
  // displayed. Visually identical, `pointer-events: none` either way —
  // but it is why `settleBootSplash` waits on the class rather than on
  // Playwright's `hidden`, which opacity alone does not satisfy.
  //
  // Passed as **source text, not a function**, and that is not a style
  // choice. `addInitScript` serialises a function argument and
  // evaluates the result in the page — but this file is compiled by
  // esbuild with `keepNames`, which rewrites a named inner function to
  // `__name(fn, 'fn')`. That helper exists in the bundle, never in the
  // page, so the injected script dies on `__name is not defined` and
  // takes every check in the smoke suite with it. A string cannot be
