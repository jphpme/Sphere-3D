/**
 * Screenshot-trace recorder for the Weblate screenshot pipeline.
 *
 * Gated entirely behind `import.meta.env.VITE_I18N_TRACE`: the only
 * production caller is `t()` in `./index.ts`, inside an
 * `if (import.meta.env.VITE_I18N_TRACE)` branch. When the flag is
 * unset Vite statically replaces it with `false`, Rollup drops the
 * call, and — because this module has no import-time side effects —
 * the whole module falls out of the bundle. Keep it side-effect-free
 * at module scope for that elimination to hold.
 *
 * When the flag *is* set (CI screenshot-capture builds only), every
 * resolved message key is collected into a Set and mirrored onto
 * `window.__i18nTrace`. The Playwright capturer drives the app to a
 * scene, reads which keys that scene rendered, and associates them
 * with the uploaded screenshot in Weblate.
 *
 * See `docs/WEBLATE_SCREENSHOT_SYNC_PLAN.md`.
