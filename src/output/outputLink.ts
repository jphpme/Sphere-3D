/**
 * The output window's side of the control ↔ output link
 * (`docs/MULTI_MONITOR_PLAN.md` §3).
 *
 * Everything the manager broadcasts has, until now, been broadcast at
 * nobody: no output emitted `output_ready`, so `readyRecords()` was
 * always empty and the whole send path was dead code in a real launch.
 * This is the other end.
 *
 * ## What it does, and the two rules that carry the correctness
 *
 * **A diff is applied only if it is newer; a snapshot is applied
 * always.** The output coalesces queued messages most-recent-wins, so a
 * late diff arriving after a fresh one would silently show the wrong
 * frame — hence `seq`. But a *snapshot* is not a new event: `full()`
 * deliberately does not advance `seq`, because it restates a point the
 * sequence already reached. Two things depend on accepting it anyway:
 * the idle heartbeat, which resyncs an output that missed a diff by
 * sending a full at the *same* `seq` it already holds, and a manager
 * restart, after which `seq` resets to a low number and arrives with a
 * full. Gating snapshots on `seq` would break both — the first silently,
 * the second permanently.
 *
 * That leaves one assumption worth naming: a snapshot that genuinely is
 * stale, delivered *after* a newer diff, would roll state back. It
 * relies on the event channel delivering in order, which Tauri's does.
 *
 * **A snapshot is not "everything changed".** The heartbeat sends a
 * full every second while the globe is idle. An output that reported
 * every key on each one would rebuild its HLS instance once per second,
 * on a projector, for the life of the session. So an accepted message
 * reports only the keys whose values actually *differ*, compared with
 * `stateEquality`'s `sameValue` — the same function the aggregator uses
 * to decide what to send, because two answers to that question is the
 * bug itself.
 *
 * ## Ordering at connect
 *
 * The listener is installed **before** `output_ready` is emitted. The
 * manager replies to that event by marking the record ready and sending
 * its first full snapshot immediately; emitting first would race the
 * listener against the reply, and the output would sit on the idle Earth
 * until the next heartbeat.
 *
 * ## Seams
 *
 * `OutputLinkHost` is the whole platform surface — identity, listen,
 * emit — so the link is testable with no Tauri, no window and no second
 * monitor, the same trade `MultiOutputHost` makes on the control side.
 * `createTauriLinkHost()` is the only Tauri importer here.
