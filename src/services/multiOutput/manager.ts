/**
 * `MultiOutputManager` — the control window's side of the multi-monitor
 * output feature (`docs/MULTI_MONITOR_PLAN.md` §3).
 *
 * It enumerates monitors, spawns and tears down `output-*` windows,
 * and is the single source of truth every output mirrors: state goes in
 * through `applyState`, out through `StateAggregator`, and onto the
 * wire one `emitTo` per live output. Outputs never ask for state on
 * their own initiative after `output_ready`.
 *
 * ## The Tauri surface is a seam, and the ordering is not
 *
 * Everything platform-specific goes through `MultiOutputHost`, and
 * `createTauriHost()` is the only implementation that imports Tauri.
 * That is not decoration: the one part of this module a spike actually
 * caught a bug in — the spawn sequence — is arithmetic and ordering,
 * and putting it behind a seam is what makes it testable on a
 * one-monitor CI runner with no Tauri at all.
 *
 * The sequence is spawn-hidden → position → size → fullscreen → show,
 * and each step is there for a reason the plan's "Monitor geometry and
 * placement" records:
 *
 * - **Hidden first.** `fullscreen: true` at construction fullscreens
 *   onto whichever monitor the window happened to land on, and a
 *   visible window sliding across the desk is an artifact on a capture
 *   feed at exactly the moment an installation is being set up.
 * - **Physical, unconverted.** `WindowOptions.x/y/width/height` are
 *   *logical* pixels; `availableMonitors()` reports *physical* ones.
 *   Only `setPosition`/`setSize` take physical values, so the placement
 *   cannot be one call. Passing the monitor's own numbers through
 *   unconverted means there is no `scaleFactor` arithmetic to get wrong
 *   — which matters because a mixed-DPI desk puts the window on the
 *   wrong monitor and reads as "the feature is broken" rather than as a
 *   units bug.
 * - **Signed origins.** The spike's `\\.\DISPLAY1` sat at `x = −1680`.
 *   Nothing here may assume a non-negative origin.
 * - **`show()` last**, which is why §6 grants `core:window:allow-show`:
 *   `visible: false` is a free constructor option, but bringing the
 *   window back is a command and `core:window:default` is getters only.
 *
 * ## What is deliberately not here yet
 *
 * Persistence (commit 10), the Outputs panel (commit 9), and the whole
 * of failure recovery — crash detection, the monitor-unplug poll, the
 * orphan boot scan, health badges (commit 13). `handleOutputEvent`
 * therefore records what an output reports and does not yet act on it;
 * the events are part of the protocol from commit 1, and dropping them
 * on the floor until commit 13 would mean commit 13 has to re-derive
 * which ones arrive.

   * The case is a control window whose **webview** reloaded or crashed
   * and came back — a dev reload, a renderer the OS recycled — leaving
   * its sibling output windows alive and still rendering while a fresh
   * `MultiOutputManager` boots with an empty `records` map. The plan
   * frames this as a control-window *crash* and describes killing the
   * process to reproduce it; that is not the same thing, and the
   * distinction matters to anyone testing this. Every window belongs to
   * one Tauri process, so killing it takes the outputs with it. What
   * survives is a reload of the page, not a death of the app.
   *
   * Without this, those windows are unreachable in every sense that
   * counts: `handleOutputEvent` drops an event whose label has no
   * record, so their health pings go nowhere; the panel cannot list or
   * remove them; the decoder budget does not count them; `closeAll()`
   * cannot close them. They keep rendering a frame from before the
   * reload, forever, which on a projector is indistinguishable from
   * working.
   *
   * **Unconditional, unlike `restoreOutputs`.** The opt-in governs
   * whether the manager *spawns* windows on launch; a window that is
   * already on a projector exists whether or not anyone opted in, and
   * refusing to adopt it would leave the operator with a display they
   * cannot reach. It still costs a launch that has never used outputs
   * exactly one call, because a host with nothing to report returns an
   * empty array and this stops before enumerating a monitor or opening
   * the link — the same property `restoreOutputs` protects.
   *
   * **Runs before `restoreOutputs`, and that ordering is load-bearing.**
   * A surviving window holds its label, and the restore spawns from the
   * same persisted entries by label — so without the scan first, a
   * restore would try to create a second `output-1` on a monitor that
   * already has one. Adopted labels are in `records` by the time the
   * restore reads the config, and it skips them.
   *
   * Three things get closed rather than adopted, and each is the same
   * judgement: the manager will not put a row in the panel it cannot
   * describe truthfully.
   *
   * - **A label with no persisted entry.** There is nothing to build a
   *   record from — no monitor, no view settings, no render config —
   *   and `reportOutputRemoved` needs a `mode` this window has not
   *   told us. Every alternative is a guess presented as fact, which is
   *   the failure the name-only monitor match was rejected for. It
   *   costs a projector going black on a path that needs the config to
   *   have been reset while windows were live.
   * - **A monitor that is no longer enumerated.** The same rule the
   *   restore applies, and the reason `monitor-gone` exists.
   * - **A window that does not answer the poke** within
   *   `OUTPUT_REATTACH_TIMEOUT_MS`. Absence is the signal, exactly as
   *   it is for a departure.
